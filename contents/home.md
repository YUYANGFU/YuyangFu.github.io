I am a senior undergraduate student from **Southeast University (SEU)**, currently participating in the **3+2 Joint Program at the University of California, Irvine (UCI)**. As part of this program, I am completing my B.S. in Electronic Science & Technology (from SEU) while taking graduate-level courses at UCI.

My primary research interest lies in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I am fortunate to be a research intern at the **THUNLP Lab, Tsinghua University**, where my work focuses on developing multi-tool LLM Agents. Concurrently, I am beginning new research at UCI exploring **LLM unlearning**.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities to continue this research, targeting admission for Fall 2026.
